### Project

The main goal of this project was to implement sliding movement into
the unreal engine movement component and react on the slope of the
surface the player is sliding on. The player can transition into a
slide by walking downhill or crouching. While sliding the speed will
increase downhill and decrease uphill. Both effects are increased
while the player crouches.

### Accomplished goals

Already implemented are the following:

- [x] Custom player movement (replicates for multiplayer)
- [x] Procedural Environment
- [x] Checkpoints, start/finish and race telemetry 
- [x] Menu System to create or join Server via Steam
